1. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?\n
                      Ans : In Supervised Machine learning We provide labled data,for example prediction of House Price. While in UnSupwevised Learning we need not have labelled data, for example, classification of emails into spam and non-spam.

2. What is the difference between classification and regression?
                                                                  Ans : Classification is used to produce discrete results, classification is used to classify data into some specific categories .for example classifying e-mails into spam and non-spam categories.
