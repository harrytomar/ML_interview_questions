1. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?\n
                      Ans : In Supervised Machine learning We provide labled data,for example prediction of House Price. While in UnSupwevised Learning we need not have labelled data, for example, classification of emails into spam and non-spam.

2. What is the difference between classification and regression?
                                                                  Ans : Classification is used to produce discrete results, classification is used to classify data into some specific categories .for example classifying e-mails into spam and non-spam categories.
Whereas, We use regression analysis when we are dealing with continuous data, for example predicting stock prices at a certain point of time. 

3. Explain Ensemble learning.    Ans : In ensemble learning, many base models like classifiers and regressors are generated and combined together so that they give better results. It is used when we build component classifiers that are accurate and independent. There are sequential as well as parallel ensemble methods. 

4. Explain dimension reduction in machine learning.       Ans : Dimension Reduction is the process of reducing the size of the feature matrix. We try to reduce the number of columns so that we get a better feature set either by combining columns or by removing extra variables.

5. Explain differences between random forest and gradient boosting algorithm.
      Ans : Random forest uses bagging techniques whereas GBM uses boosting techniques.
            Random forests mainly try to reduce variance and GBM reduces both bias and variance of a model
